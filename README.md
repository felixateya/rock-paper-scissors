# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript. The game allows a user to enter their choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The winner is determined based on the game rules.

## Usage


1. The game will prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

3. The computer will randomly select its choice.

4. The winner will be determined according to the game rules.

## Code

Here's a snippet of the JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Get user input
const playerSelection = prompt("Your choice? ").toLowerCase();

// Computer's random choice
const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];
const computerSelection = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];

// Determine the winner
const result = decalreWinner(playerSelection, computerSelection);

// Display the result
console.log(`You chose: ${playerSelection}`);
console.log(`Computer chose: ${computerSelection}`);
console.log(`Result: ${result}`);

// Function to determine the winner
function declareWinner(player, computer) {
    // ... implement your logic to determine the winner
    // return "Player wins", "Computer wins", or "It's a tie"
}
